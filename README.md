# Generate-TV-Scripts


In this project, [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts are generated using RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks). Part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons is used. The Neural Network will generate a new, "fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
